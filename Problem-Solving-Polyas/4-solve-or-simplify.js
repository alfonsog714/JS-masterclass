/* 
    Solve the problem if you can, else solve a simpler problem (sub-problems of the problem at hand)

    Simplify:
        - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
        - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
        - Write a simplified solution
        - Incorporate that difficulty back in
