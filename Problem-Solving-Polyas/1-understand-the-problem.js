        3. What are the outputs or return that should come from the solution to the problem?
        4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Basically, do you have enough information to solve the problem?
        5. How should you label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

// ===============================================================
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
// ===============================================================

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
`Implement addition.`

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// Ints? floats? What about strings for large numbers?
`We're expecting two individual integers.`

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
`We're returning an integer.`

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? 

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
`num1 and num2 for the two inputs and sum for the output.`
