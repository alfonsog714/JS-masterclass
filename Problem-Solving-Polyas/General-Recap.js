/* 
    Step 1. Understand the problem. If you can't restate the problem in your own words, you probably don't understand the question enough.
    Step 2. Explore or create concrete examples. By this I mean create an example input and what it's output should be, some example edge-cases, etc.
    Step 3. Pseudocode, or break down the problem.
    Step 4. Solve or simplify the problem. By simplify I mean create smaller sub-problems of the main problem.
    Step 5. (Most Important for improving) Look back and refactor the solution.
