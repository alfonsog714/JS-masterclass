/* 
    This pattern creates pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.

    This pattern is very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

    Usually using with structures such as arrays, strings, linked lists, etc.
    
    ==========
    An example
    ==========
    Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.

    sumZero([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]) returns [-3,3]
    sumZero([-2,0,1,3]) returns undefined
    sumZero([1]) returns undefined
