    Bubble Sort
    ===========
    - Not that efficient
    - Not commonly used

    ====================
    What is Bubble Sort?
    ====================
    A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top  

    =============
    Big O runtime
    =============
    - O(n^2)
    - If the array is nearly sorted, the runtime can be O(n) using the "noSwaps" version of bubble sort
