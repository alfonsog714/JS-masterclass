/* 
    ==============
    Selection Sort
    ==============
    - Similar to bubble sort
    - Places small values into sorted position instead of the big values

    =============
    Big O Runtime
    =============
    - Best and worst case O(n^2)
    - Potentially a better algorithm to use if for some reason you want to minimize how many swaps you do.
