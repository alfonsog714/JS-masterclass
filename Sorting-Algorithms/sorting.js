    What is sorting?
    ================
    Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.

    ========
    Examples
    ========
    - Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
    - Sorting names alphabetically
    - Sorting movies based on release year 
    - Sorting movies based on revenue

    =============================
    Why do we need to learn this?
    =============================
    - Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works.
    - There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages.

    Recap
    =====
    - Sorting is fundamental!
    - Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
    - All have average time complexities that are quadratic
    - We can do better than the elementary sorting algorithms, but we need more complex algorithms
